SpeedBreaker
============
Copyright Â© 2013 Reagan Lopez

SpeedBreaker is a phone agnostic app that warns the user if the vehicle speed increases beyond the designated street speed limit. The user is warned by a notification sound which is configurable. The speed threshold is also configurable.

This app is built using HTML5, CSS, jQueryMobile 1.3.0 and PhoneGap 2.4.0. The base speedlimit data is downloaded from Wikispeedia.

jQueryMobile is a unified, HTML5-based user interface system for all popular mobile device platforms, built on the jQuery and jQuery UI foundation.

PhoneGap is a web-based mobile development framework, based on the open-source Cordova project. PhoneGap allows you to use standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development, avoiding each mobile platforms' native development language. Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to access each device's sensors, data, and network status.

Wikispeedia is an open data collaborative project to collect a database of the locations of all speed limits around the world.

Future Feature
==============
Things to add: 

1. Develop an API interface to fetch speedlimit from wikispeedia.org in real time.

2. Determine how to retrieve speedlimit data from openstreetmap.org because openstreetmap.org has much more extensive and accurate speedlimit data. But openstreetmap.org does not have the speedlimit of a street at the level of geo coordinates.

3. Ability to contribute speedlimit data to wikispeedia.org or openstreetmap.org.
